# ðŸ“– TaleForge: A Collaborative Storytelling Platform

TaleForge is a Django-based web platform where creative writers can collaboratively build **branching, choose-your-own-adventure** style stories. Inspired by Reddit and creative writing forums, TaleForge allows users to write, contribute, vote, and explore dynamic storylines together.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Build a full-stack Django application where:

- Users can register and manage profiles with avatars and bios.
- Anyone can start a new story and write the first chapter.
- Other users propose new chapters as branches of existing ones.
- Proposed chapters go through a voting system before being added to the story tree.
- Readers can explore stories as branching paths.
